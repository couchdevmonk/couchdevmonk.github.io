You raise an interesting question.  In the sense that what is specified is
a "problem" in the subject of "linear programming", one would think that the
term should be hyphenated.  However, no one does that, so we need to think
about how the lack of a hyphen can fit the principles.  There are various
types of optimization problems: linear programming, quadratic programming,
even convex programming.  In that sense, optimization problems are
"programming problem", and here we speak of the linear kind, so this viewpoint
points to "linear programming problem".  It is reassuring to have a way to
say that the common practice is correct.  Think about the contrast between
the roles of the words in "linear programming problem" and
"polynomial-time algorithm".

This has bugged me until I realized this morning that this is the same language
problem with which
Abraham Lincoln struggled in his Gettysburg address.  The English language
desperately needs a super preposition
embodying all three prepositions, "of", "by" and "for".  I guess Lincoln
essentially used this
to define democracy.  Perhaps the title of our paper should have been
"Interval Democracy" (this is not
a serious suggestion) since we define representation of intervals, by
intervals, and for intervals.

To Velleman:
The problem is that we don't have an adjectival form of "Cauchy".
Using a (proper) noun as a predicate adjective is a jargonistic abuse of
language.  We don't say that a group is Abel or a sequence is Sturm or
a graph is Euler.  Attaching the name to a noun is the linguistic trick to
allow it to function as an adjective, as in "sex education".  This is why
"is a Cauchy sequence" is less objectionable.

Yes, after thinking about it for many years I believe that it is generally best
to be consistent in treating equations as noun units.  (I make an exception for
the reading of "Let x=...".)  Equations as clauses get into too much trouble.
Usually if one wants to emphasize the verb it is better to use words, as in
"Recall that c_0 and m_0 both equal 1".  I agree that here the verb "Recall"
make the lack of "that" a bit awkward.  Hence I will accept "that" in this
case but still think that the full sentence is better (partly for consistency).

To Xingzhi Zhan on "vertex cut" vs. "cut-vertex":
  Maybe it is clearer that "vertex" or "edge" is modifying "cut"
in "vertex cut" and "edge cut" than it is that "cut" is modfying
the others in "cut vertex" or "cut edge".
  Maybe the use of the hyphen in one ordering of the words and not in
the other ("vertex cut" vs. "cut-vertex") makes it clearer that the
two phrasings have different meanings.  (This could be helpful to
native speakers of other languages.)
  Maybe it is something in the rhythm of the words that suggests emphasizing
that the term is a unit when the "cut" comes first.
  Maybe it is because "vertex" and "edge" are clearly nouns being used as
adjectives, but "cut" can be used as a verb.

What would the MAA do with "Pike's Peak"?  Every
   sensible person know that this should be capitalized; it is a proper noun.
   The grammar is no different for "Pick's Theorem".  In Phoenix there is
   South Mountain; no one would call it south mountain.

I acknowledge that "Since" has a temporal meaning, but "as" has too many
other common uses.  "As I recall", "as well as", "as snug as a bug in a rug",
"as in the next result", etc.  There is also a mathematical usage, "as x->0",
referring to limiting behavior.  In mathematical discourse, "since" is a short 
form of "because" and rarely has temporal meaning.  Furthermore, a temporal 
context can be indicated clearly by putting the time immediately after "since",
as in "Since 1958, when I was born, there has never".  Therefore, I prohibit 
"as" in the implicative sense.

Good question for the Grammar.  Here I would not capitalize; it is like
a compound sentence using a semicolon.  The label situation is like the
start of a theorem statement.

Comment:

clarify that "girth" is a parameter of a graph, not a cycle; a cycle in a
  graph has a length, not a girth.  Similarly, a vertex in a graph has only
  one degree, not one degree for each incident edge.  Also, "has girth", not
  "has a girth".


Hartke: Another issue that I've noticed students have difficulty with is
singular/plural issues, particularly when talking about collections.  This is
somewhat addressed in #59 with "every", but the issue is larger than that.  For
instance, consider: "Let $S$ be the set of graphs that have an edge-clique cover
equal to the number of vertices."  There's a lot of problems with number in this
sentence.  "that" is plural ("graphs that have"), but then we have "*an*
edge-clique covering"-is there just one covering for all the graphs?  It's not
even clear to me what the appropriate solution is here, but this issue has
arisen frequently.

From: Kira Hamman <khh11@psu.edu>
I knew a woman in graduate school, a non-native English speaker, who said
that the way she remembered when to use "many" and when to use "much" is
that "many" refers to countable sets (people, books, miles) and "much"
refers to uncountable sets (sand, water, time). She was using those words
in a non-technical sense, of course, but I always thought it was a clever
way to frame that.
   I just asked a colleague in English about this and it turns out that they
call this distinction "countable" versus "non-countable." Countable in
English seems to mean pretty much the same thing it does in math, except of
course that they are usually in practice talking about finite sets.
Non-countable, though, refers to collective nouns. It seems, upon
reflection, that such nouns do not even meaningfully *have* a property of
quantity - you can have "cups of water" or "molecules of water," but
"water" itself does not have quantity. So, in some sense, I guess this is
describing a variant on the mathematically uncountable, but it's not the
same. "Fewer" and "less" have the same distinction, as do "number" and
"amount."



%    similarly, "let a= and b=" doesn't need second "let" when no English verb

minimizing use of "of".  "of" vs "on", "with", "for"; avoid repeated "of"


Do not insert commas around "if and only if" in mathematics.
"if and only if" is a logical connector, not a separator.
(Also not "if, and only if,")

 Your grammar doesn't address the issue of commas in iff statements. I think
 "... if, and only if, ..." is the way it should be. Yet others believe that,
 in a mathematical context, it should be "... if and only if ..." I couldn't
 imagine using this phrase in ordinary English without commas. Do you have an
 opinion on this burning question? - Craig Larson

"much fewer" - This one is subtle.  "Fewer" refers to individual items, while
"much" is used with abstract plurals.  For example, we would say "much less
water" and "many fewer papers", not "much fewer water" or
"much less papers".

Wikipedia:
In prescriptive grammar fewer is the prescribed comparative to be used in
relation to grammatically plural, discretely quantifiable nouns, i.e., count
nouns. The comparative less, it is argued, should be used when speaking of a
grammatically singular noun (including mass nouns). Descriptive grammarians,
however, are only concerned with the extent that this distinction applies in
actual human usage.

The prescriptivist distinction can be seen in this example: "There is less flour
in this canister", but "There are fewer cups (grains, pounds, bags, etc.) of
flour in this canister", as flour is a mass noun unless it is measured in a unit
(in this case cups). However, in the case of singular but discretely
quantifiable nouns as in "one less cup of flour in this canister", the adjective
"less" should be used, the prescriptivists argue.

Use of display (Igor Pak):
  You have too many inline formulas, one even in the abstract.  The rule
  of thumb is: if a formula is longer than 1/3 of a line, or has a
  fraction, or because of TeX formatting doesn't fit into one line -
  make it a real $$formula$$  For example, a binomial coeff is fine, but
  its definition is certainly not and should be a real formula.
the definition of a binomial coefficient is a reminder in
passing an should not be displayed.  When a short formula that does not need
display for other reasons has a line break due to tex, the choice should be
to rewrite the sentence rather than to display the formula.  Displaying all
formulas having fractions is tremendous overkill and is not in the spirit of
smooth communication.  I find papers with many displayed formulas wasteful of
space and more difficult (or at least less appealing) to read.  Certainly the
abstract should try to avoid displays.

We:
The single-author situation is not a problem, due to convention of the "royal"
we, but also supported by the notion that the reader is participating in the
proof along with the author.  
   Nevetheless, too much use of "we" is stilted and unpleasant.  To avoid this,
use active verbs or an implied imperatives where possible to write sentences
without explicit pronouns.  For example, "Define" instead of "We define", etc.
Similarly, "Constructing the connected 2-factor implies that G is Hamiltonian."


Discussion to incorporate:
"Conjunction" means combining two sentences into one sentence.  It is thus
mathematically improper to start a sentence with a conjunction.  You would not
start break a mathematical formula before a \wedge, and similarly it is
illogical to break a sentence before "And".  I would be extremely surprised to
find people who would consider "Jack fell down.  And broke his crown" correct
except in poetic writing.  I think your example here is indefensible, especially
in the sense that writing of mathematics needs to be more formal because its
concepts are more abstract, without clues from the physical universe to help the
reader interpret what is meant.

There are two senses of "Then": the temporal sense and the implicative sense.
In the temporal sense, you are correct that "Then" is an adverb and can start a
sentence.  In the implicative sense, "then" is a conjunction in logical
statements just like "\wedge", and for that reason it should not start a
sentence.  I would guess that the "several other people" you have consulted are
mathematicians.  Many mathematicians consider "Let ...  Then" to be a matter of
taste because it is a matter of habit.  In fact, it is bad writing that results
from laziness.  "Then" in the implicative sense should be treated as a
conjunction, and conjunctions should not start sentences.  The dictionary page
you quote shows only the adverbial sense of then, indicated by the superscript
"1".  It does not give an example with the conjunctive implicative sense
starting a sentence.  Presumably there is a second definition of "then" with
superscript "2" on the next page (as in the earlier options for "them" on the
given page).  Thus I conclude that the evidence you have provided supports my
position, not yours.  

The prevalence of sentences starting with "Then" in your paper does make reading
the proofs less pleasant and more difficult.  It means that you have separated
the conclusion from the hypothesis, leaving the reader the responsibility of
putting them back together.  This slows the reader down and thus discourages the
reader from reading the proofs.

It is unassailable that "G-G'" is ambiguous and hence should not be used.
Diestel has an entire book in which to adopt whatever conventions he wants;
readers who use his book long enough will become accustomed to his notation.  In
the shorter context of a research article, one should wherever possible use
unambiguous notation that cannot confuse a reader who does not take the trouble
to look it up.  I have many, many disagreements with Diestel's notation and
style, which I believe reduces readability in many ways.  The pages you provided
are full of examples of this.  They show me the choices that Diestel has made,
but they does not convince me that his choices are correct or, more to the
point, beneficial to readers.

When separating points of a proof as lemmas, the structure that is easier to
follow is to state at the outset what is going to be proved without formally
starting the proof environment, then to give the lemmas with their proof, and
then prove the theorem within its own proof environment using the lemmas.  Of
course, a proof may have enormous complexity, but it is always possible to write
the proof without using nested proof environments.  Avoiding nested proof
environments may take more effort on the part of the authors but is friendlier
to the reader.
One would not give the proof of the Graph Minor Theorem by stating the theorem,
starting a proof environment, and proceeding with 500 pages of lemmas with their
own proof environments nested within it.  That is an extreme case, but the
principle is the same.

You assert that some authors define the complement of a graph to mean something
other than the definition that all textbooks in graph theory give to the term.
I find it rather sad that they were not required to change this before
publication.  That is worse than a matter of grammar; it is damaging to the
discipline.  Meanwhile, the point of my comment about "complement" was the level
of the terms being defined.  "Complement" is more elementary than "complete
bipartite graph"; my point is that if "complete bipartite graph" is not defined,
then it does not make sense to define "complement".  A reader who is assumed to
know what "complete bipartite graph" means would at best find the definition of
"complement" superfluous.  Irresponsibility of some authors in mis-defining
"complement" does not change that conclusion.

I acknowledge that many mathematicians use "|" for "such that".  It is overused
notation (used also for restriction, cardinality, and divisibility).  The colon
has fewer conflicting usages, and the meaning "such that" rather closely
approximates the meaning of this punctuation in written English ("|" has no such
role in English.  These reasons are the evidence that the colon is simply
better.  I am not claiming that "|" is not also commonly used, only that ":" is
better.

I stand on the opinions I have expressed about the ways in which the writing of
your paper can be improved.  I give reasons to support these opinions here and
on my grammar page.  My aim is to improve the presentation of what is published,
making it easier to read and understand what has been written.  Nevertheless,
the mathematics is paramount.  The referees, who are not native speakers of
English, find the mathematics publishable.  If most interested readers will be
able to figure out eventually what is meant by less than optimal writing of
English that authors refuse to change, then I will not override the mathematical
decision by a grammatical one.

*****
If should be followed by "then" in implications, in contrast to familiar 
English where the context is known.  Compare
"If G is bipartite, G has no odd cycle, and G has chromatic number 2."
"If G is bipartite, G has no cycle, and G has bounded degree."

Avoid if/then in definition
Ethan Bloch:
Suggested Revision: If $X$ is a regular CW complex, then the face poset of $X$,
denoted $P(X)$, is the poset that has one element for each cell of $X$, where
the order relation is given by $\sigma < \tau$ if $\sigma$ is in the boundary of
$
\tau$, for cells $\sigma$ and $\tau$ of $X$. The poset $P(X)$ is ranked, where
the rank of a cell in $X$ is its dimension.
Actual Revision: Let $X$ be a regular CW complex. The face poset of $X$,
denoted $P(X)$, is the poset that has one element for each cell of $X$, where
the order relation is given by $\sigma < \tau$ if $\sigma$ is in the boundary of
$
\tau$, for cells $\sigma$ and $\tau$ of $X$. The poset $P(X)$ is ranked, where
the rank of a cell in $X$ is its dimension.
The suggested change would not work, for the following reason. If we write a
sentence of the form â€œIf P, then Q,â€ it is not correct to assume that either P
or Q is
true, but only that there is a certain relationship between P and Q. That is, if
one
writes a sentence â€œIf P, then Q,â€ one cannot assume in the subsequent sentences
that P is true. In particular, in the suggested revision, the first sentence is
â€œIf $X$
is a regular CW complex, then ...â€ It is not logically correct to assume that
the
symbol $X$ is defined after the end of that sentence, because the definition of
$X
$ is the P in a sentence of the form â€œIf P, then Q.â€ That causes a problem with
the suggested revision, because the symbol $X$ is in fact used in the
subsequent sentence. Fortunately, the actual revision, which simply drops the
word â€œThenâ€ at the start of the second sentence and leave everything else
unchanged, solves the grammatical problem you identified and yet does not
cause any logical problems.
In general, I find the problem of defining symbols as the P in a sentence of the
form â€œIf P, then Q,â€ and then using that symbol in a subsequent sentence, to be
very widespread among students; it is something that I work very hard to combat.
A similar problem occurs when a symbol is defined inside a quantifier, for
example â€œWe deduce that $n^2$ is even for all even numbers $n$.â€ The number
$n$ is not defined outside that sentence (because it is a dummy variable), and
cannot be used in subsequent sentences (unless defined properly, via â€œLet $n$
be an even numberâ€). The basic principle is that every symbol should be defined
before it is used, and one has to look carefully at whether each definition
exists
only for the duration of that sentence, or persists afterwards. I have seen
students make serious mistakes in proofs because they used symbols that they
thought were defined but were in fact not. That type of problem appears
regularly when students learn epsilon-delta proofs.
A particular case of this problem occurs when the sentence â€œIf P, then Qâ€ is the
statement of a theorem that needs to be proved. If a theorem says â€œIf P, then
Q,â€
then the first sentence of a direct proof needs to be â€œSuppose P.â€ Many students
fail to say that. If, grammar aside, a theorem says â€œSuppose P. Then Q,â€ then
the proof should not start with â€œSuppose P,â€ because P was already assumed in
the statement of the theorem. I now understand the grammatical problem
caused by starting a sentence with â€œThen,â€ but removing it should be done in a
way that does not cause a symbol that is used subsequently to be undefined.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I have been accumulating observations about writing mathematics for many years.
        These conclusions arose both from writing textbooks and from noting writing
        errors commonly made by my thesis students and in papers submitted to journals.
    
    <p>
        My first objective was to train my students, thereby reducing the time needed
        to edit their theses. As the document grew, I made it publicly available in
        the hope that others may find it useful. I have received a broad range of
        responses, mostly positive. If you don't find it useful (or if you object to
        it on principle), then please ignore it. I hope to make some writers of
        mathematics (especially students and non-native speakers of English) aware of
        issues they may not have considered; small changes can produce mathematical
        writing that is easier to read by wider audiences.
    
    <p>
        After an <a class="link" href="#introduction">introductory explanation</a> of why care in

        Some points are minor distinctions, but even these make mathematical writing
        clearer when used consistently. My intent is not to make writing rigid, but
        rather to make it transparent to avoid distracting the reader by ambiguities or
        awkwardness in the flow of the narrative.
    
    <p>
        I note that a number of other articles and even books have been published on
        writing mathematics; see some of these <a class="link" href="#references">here</a>.
        I list these just to make alternative viewpoints available, without judgment
        pro or con. One contrast to note is that my list below focuses on relatively
        specific items. I have not yet included much discussion of the general
        structure of an article; some of these references discuss that.

    <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Live mathematical conversations use many shortcuts that are inappropriate in
        precise mathematical writing. The context is known by all participants, and
        shortcuts evolve to save time. Furthermore, the speaker can immediately
        clarify ambiguity. Without immediate access to the author, written mathematics
        must use language more carefully. Also, mathematical concepts are abstract,
        without context from everyday experience, so the writing must be more
        consistent to make the meaning clear. Outside mathematics, imprecise writing
        can still be understood because the objects and concepts discussed are familiar.
    
    <p>
        Some mathematicians object to some of my recommendations. Many time-honored
        practices in the writing of mathematics are grammatically incorrect. These
        mistakes in writing cause no difficulty for readers with sufficient
        mathematical sophistication or familiarity with the subject, but it is
        unnecessary to restrict the audience to such readers. A bit of care leads to
        clearer writing that makes mathematics more easily accessible and readable to a
        wider and less specialized audience.
    
    <p>
        Some languages have conventions of usage or grammar that lead to typical errors
        in English mathematical writing by their native speakers. I discuss some
        such items in a separate section at the end. I use some terminology for
        English parts of speech and punctuation in the explanations. I hope that
        readers who are unfamiliar with these terms will still benefit from seeing
        the recommendations.
    
    <p>
        I apologize in advance for my own grammatical errors. Habits die hard, and it
        is easy to err in applying principles of writing. In particular, there are
        inconsistencies between what I propose here and what I wrote in my earlier
        books. Those books were written in the previous millennium, and I have learned
        many things about writing since then. Also, I am a speaker of American
        English, and some points are consistently different in British English (such as
        the treatment of "which" vs. "that" and the aversion to serial commas).
    
    <p>
        Some of my conclusions conflict with manuals of English style. My conclusions
        are intended to produce clear mathematical writing that is more logically
        consistent than publishers' conventions. This applies especially to
        punctuation and to words that serve as logical connectives.
    
    <p>
        I welcome corrections, suggestions/inquiries, and "pet peeves" that may lead to
        further items in later versions of this guide.

                    <i>Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion.</i>
                    We begin with the overall structure of a research article in mathematics.
                    The abstract states the results as fully as possible in a brief presentation.
                    Crucial specialized terms the reader needs to know to understand the statements
                    should be defined. The abstract stands on its own, especially in the age of
                    electronic communication where it may be separate from the rest of the paper,
                    and hence it contains no numbered reference to the bibliography.
    
                    <p>
                        The first section of the paper is an "Introduction" that should motivate the
                        problem, discuss related results, state the results more completely, and
                        perhaps summarize the techniques or the structure of the paper or crucial
                        definitions.
    
                        <p> The introduction should also contain any <i>concluding remarks</i> or key
                            conjectures. There is generally little or no value in a separate section of
                            concluding remarks. Such remarks either are redundant or contain information
                            that readers usually seek in the introduction. Readers who study the full
                            details of the proofs have no need of a summary in a concluding section.
                            Readers who do not read the full details have no desire to go on to a
                            concluding section. A mathematical research article is not read like a
                            novel or even like an essay that seeks to "persuade" the reader; it does not
                            need an epilogue.
    
                        <p>
            <li>
                <a name="definitions"><i>Definitions.</i></a>
                Words being defined should be distinguished by italics (or perhaps boldface in
                a textbook context). When italics are used to indicate a word being defined,
                it is unnecessary to use "called" or "said to be"; the use of italics
                announces that this is the term being defined and replaces these words.
    
                <p>
                    Many definitions are phrased as "An object has property <i>italicized term</i>
                    <b>if</b> <i>condition</i> holds." Here we use the word "if" even though
                    subsequently it is understood that an object satisfies the property being
                    defined <i>if and only if</i> the given condition holds. The italicization
                    alerts the reader to this situation. The convention can be justified by saying
                    that the property or object does not actually exist until the definition is
                    complete, so one does not yet in the definition formally say that the named
                    property is equivalent to the condition.
    
                <p>
                    Definitions written by non-native speakers sometimes contain extra commas.
                    In each sentence below, the comma should be deleted.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    "A <i>bipartite graph</i>, is a graph that is 2-colorable".
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    "A graph is <i>bipartite</i>, if it is 2-colorable".
                    <br>
                    The first example is a mistaken placement of a comma inside a clause (see
                    discussion of <a class="link" href="#extracommas">Commas</a>).
    
                <p>
                    Note the difference in italicization above. When written as an adjective-noun
                    combination, the term being defined is the name for structures that have the
                    property; hence the full term <i>bipartite graph</i> is italicized. When the
                    property alone is being defined and is positioned as a predicate adjective,
                    only the adjective is italicized.
    
                <p>
            <li>
                <a name="where">
                    <i>"Where".</i>
                    A formula may contain notation that has not yet been defined, if the definition
                    of that notation follows immediately in the same sentence. The formula is then
                    followed by a comma and the word "where" to introduce the definition. For
                    example, "If <i>G</i> is a bipartite graph, then <i>&chi;'(G)&le;&Delta;(G)</i>,
                    where <i>&chi;'(G)</i> is the edge-chromatic number and <i>&Delta;(G)</i> is the
                    maximum degree of <i>G</i>." (Technically, the second comma is needed because
                    the subsequent definition is an <a class="link" href="#appositive">appositive</a>).
    
                    <p>
                        Note the difference between "where" and "such that".
                        "Where" is used when the preceding notation is being defined; "such that"
                        is used when it is already defined and its value is being restricted.
    
                        <p>
            <li>
                <a name="dblduty"><i>Double-Duty Definitions.</i></a>
                One cannot make a statement about an object before the object has been defined.
                Similarly, one cannot use notation as part of a formula making a statement
                about the denoted object unless the notation has previously been defined. In
                particular, these tasks cannot correctly be accomplished at the same time with
                one instance of the notation.
                For example, "The <i>neighborhood</i> of a vertex <i>v</i> is
                <i>N(v)={u: uv&isin; E(G)}</i>"
                is incorrect. With a subject and a verb before the equation, the equation
                is a single unit (see <a class="link" href="#expressions">expressions as units</a>).
                This sentence defines the neighborhood of <i>v</i> to be a particular
                equation, and it does not define the notation <i>N(v)</i>.
    
                <p>
                    Of course, readers sufficiently familiar with the context have no trouble
                    understanding what is meant, but why disenfranchise other readers? One can
                    just as easily write "The <i>neighborhood</i> of a vertex <i>v</i>, denoted
                    <i>N(v)</i>, is <i>{u: uv&isin; E(G)}</i>". Alternatively, one can introduce
                    the notation as an <a class="link" href="#appositive">appositive</a> in a conventional
                    position immediate after the term defined: "The <i>neighborhood</i> <i>N(v)</i>
                    of a vertex <i>v</i> is <i>{u: uv&isin; E(G)}</i>".

                    <a name="G=V,E">
                        A common Double-Duty definition is "Let <i>G=(V,E)</i> be a graph". The
                        sentence defines the equation <i>G=(V,E)</i> to be a graph. Of course, the
                        writer intends simultaneously to introduce notation for a particular graph and
                        its vertex set and edge set, but that is not what the sentence says. It is
                        better to write "Let <i>G</i> be a graph" and use operators <i>V</i> and
                        <i>E</i> to refer to the vertex and edge sets of <i>G</i> as <i>V(G)</i> and
                        <i>E(G)</i> (see also <a class="link" href="#operators">Operators vs. constants</a>.)
    
                        <p>
                            A more subtle example is "For each <i>1&le; i&le; n</i>,". The introduction of
                            the notation <i>i</i> has been lost because the inequalities impose conditions
                            on it before it is defined. Since the expression is a unit, grammatically the
                            phrase is referring to each inequality written in this way. Correct
                            alternatives that express the intended meaning include "For all <i>i</i> such
                            that <i>1&le;i&le;n</i>", "For <i>i&isin;[n]</i>", and "For
                            <i>1&le;i&le;n</i>". The third option is slightly different from the others;
                            it means "whenever <i>i</i> is such that the conditions hold", implicitly
                            introducing <i>i</i> in a specified range but avoiding the grammatical problem.

                Is an equation or inequality a noun unit, or is it read with the relational
                symbol as a verb? Treating the symbol as a verb often forces rereading to
                clarify the meaning, and one often wants to have another verb in the sentence.
                For these reasons, it is best to treat notational expressions as single objects
                (that is, nouns), with some exceptions.
    
                <p>
                    For example, "there exists <i>i&lt;j</i> with
                    <i>x<sub>i</sub>=x<sub>j</sub></i>" ascribes a property to the inequality
                    <i>i&lt;j</i> (and is a Double-Duty Definition of <i>i</i>). Without context,
                    it is hard to tell that the author meant "there exists <i>i</i> such that
                    <i>i&lt;j</i> and <i>x<sub>i</sub>=x<sub>j</sub></i>". Consider also "The
                    number of nonneighbors is <i>n-1-d(u)&ge; i</i>." The number of nonneighbors is
                    not an inequality, it is a number; the author is trying to make two statements
                    in one inequality. For clarity, separate the statements: "The number of
                    nonneighbors is <i>n-1-d(u)</i>, which is at least <i>i</i>".
    
                <p>
                    <i>Exceptions.</i> Applying this principle with very simple expressions leads
                    to ponderous writing. Here are two notable exceptions:
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    1) In "Choose <i>x&isin; V(G)</i> such that <i>x</i> has minimum degree," we
                    are choosing <i>x</i>, not the expression "<i>x&isin; V(G)</i>". The
                    justification for this exception is that the membership or containment symbol
                    is read as "in", which is not a verb. (One can treat nonmembership in the same
                    way.)
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    2) "Let <i>G'=G-x</i>". When introducing notation for an object or expression
                    by a single imperative verb ("let", "set", "put", "choose", etc.), we read the
                    equality symbol as the verb "equal", truly an exception. This exception can
                    be recognized by the lack of any English verb in the sentence. Continuing with
                    another verb, as in "Let <i>G'=G-x</i> be ...", would produce
                    a <a class="link" href="#dblduty">Double Duty Definition</a>.
    
                <p>
                    If the introductory part of the sentence is longer, then we may already have a
                    noun and a verb, and the expression again becomes a unit. For example,
                    "Include each vertex independently with probability <i>p=(</i>ln<i> n)/n</i>"
                    should be "Include each vertex independently with probability <i>p</i>, where
                    <i>p=(</i>ln<i> n)/n</i>".

                    <i>Separation of formulas.</i>
                    Avoid placing two formulas consecutively, separated only by a comma. For
                    example, "For <i>x<0</i>, <i>x&sup2;>0</i>" may be read as something other than
                            a hypothesis and a conclusion. Similarly, "For some <i>k</i> with
                            <i>k&lt;n</i>, <i>n-k+f(n)&lt;n/2</i>" requires the reader to stop and go back
                            to insert the missing words. The difficulty arises because commas occur also
                            in notation, and the eye cannot distinguish between commas that occur in
                            notation and commas that are intended to cause a pause or to substitute for
                            words.
                            The mathematics will be easier to read when the formulas are separated by the
                            comma plus words that enable the reader to understand the sentence at the first
                            reading. Such phrases are "it follows that", "we have", etc.
    
                            <p>
                                [On the other hand, "we have" is an awkward phrase that often should be
                                dropped when not needed to separate formulas. For example, instead of
                                "By the preceding theorem, we have <i>A=B</i>," prefer "By the preceding
                                theorem, <i>A=B</i>".]
    
                            <p>
                                When the second formula just specifies an object, the separation can be
                                accomplished by specifying the type of object, as in "When <i>k=2</i>, the
                                graph <i>G</i> is Eulerian" instead of "When <i>k=2</i>, <i>G</i> is Eulerian."
                                One can always rewrite notational expressions separated by a comma to avoid
                                the difficulty. Usually this is easy, as in changing "For every bipartite
                                graph <i>G</i>, <i>&chi;(G)&le;2</i>" to "If <i>G</i> is bipartite, then
                                <i>&chi;(G)&le;2</i>".

                    Never begin a sentence with notation. Always one can prepend a specifier (such
                    as "The graph <i>G</i> is" instead of "<i>G</i> is") or rewrite the sentence in
                    another way to avoid starting with notation. Following this rule makes
                    mathematics easier to read. The principle here is similar to the separation
                    of formulas. An exception is that the statement of a numbered theorem may
                    begin (or be entirely) a formula, because the numbered designation serves as
                    a label that begins the sentence.

                    <i>Lists of size 2.</i>
                    It is common but ungrammatical to write "Let <i>x,y</i> be vertices in
                    <i>G</i>"; we would not write "My friends John, Mary came to dinner."
                    The concatenation is an instance of two formulas separated by a comma.
                    To see what can go wrong, consider the following clause:
                    "Since <i>a|b</i> and <i>a,b</i> are maximal and minimal,".
                    What was meant was:
                    "Since <i>a|b</i>, with <i>a</i> maximal and <i>b</i> minimal,".
                    In general, the comma within a list of two elements should be replaced with
                    "and" when discussing the two elements as individual items. For example, "If
                    <i>x,y</i> are adjacent" should be "If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
                    adjacent" or "If <i>{x,y}</i> is a pair of adjacent vertices".

                        <i>Exceptions.</i>
                        With lists of size at least three, omission of "and" does not cause as much
                        confusion, and including it can be awkard. Here the objection to the common
                        mathematical convention is much weaker: we accept "Let <i>x,y,z</i> be the
                        vertices of <i>T</i>," although writing "Let <i>{x,y,z}</i> be the vertex set
                        of <i>T</i>" would be more precise. Still, "let <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and
                        <i>z</i> be the vertices" reads better.
    
                        <p>
                            Another sensible exception is "Choose <i>x,y&isin; V(G)</i>". Here the relation
                            is between each variable and the set, and we accept this as a single formula.
                            Again a justification is that we can read <i>&isin;</i> as the single word
                            "in", without a verb. Similarly, many mathematicians write, "For
                            <i>n,m&ge;2</i>" to mean the conjunction of <i>n&ge;2</i> and <i>m&ge;2</i>.
                            The exception for the membership symbol is consistent with other exceptions for
                            the membership symbol; doing it with inequalities is more questionable. Avoid
                            doing it with equalities (see <a class="link" href="#varlist">Variable equal to list</a>).
    
                            it unnecessarily requires a pause for the reader to figure it out.

                    Many writers of mathematics impose restrictions parenthetically or via commas,
                    thereby omitting words in sentences and juxtaposing formulas. This makes
                    reading unnecessarily difficult. Parentheses around notation are mathematical
                    objects and hence cannot substitute for words. A phrase like "Let

                    <p>Other examples: "Suppose there is an edge <i>xy (&ne;e)</i> in <i>G</i>"

                        than "Consider <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>1&le;i&le;n</i>)". One can also
                        separate by putting words into the parentheses: "For <i>k&le; m</i> (where

                    mathematical sense of a conditional statement. When there are many hypotheses,
                    resulting in too long a sentence, some creativity can be applied. First a
                    sentence (perhaps beginning with "Let") sets the context. The last crucial
                    hypothesis is saved for a statement of implication, using the "If/then" form.
    
                    <p>
                        Used at the beginning of a sentence, the English word "Then" is temporal, as
                        in "Then we left." Since the implicative sense of "then" is so common in
                        mathematics, the temporal sense should rarely be used, to avoid confusion.
                        Usually the temporal "then" at the beginning of a sentence can be changed to
                        "Now" or "Next" with less confusion and essentially the same (and more
                        accurate) meaning, especially in a proof.
    
                        <p>
                            Writing "Let . . ., then . . ." in one sentence is similarly problematic.
                            This sentence is constructed from one correct sentence by changing the first
                            clause to a completely different sentence. The content is that of a
                            conditional statement, but it is not written as a conditional statement.
                            This style seems to result from a conscious effort to subordinate language
                            to jargon.

                    For ease of understanding, a sentence that begins with "If" should later
                    have ", then" to start the conclusion. The word "then" should not be omitted,
                    and a comma should precede it. The comma can be omitted in a brief implication
                    contained within a clause already set off by a comma, as in "Since <i>f</i> is
                    the squaring function, if <i>x=0</i> then <i>f(x)=0</i>".

                        When readability would be improved by omitting "then", the sentence should
                        instead start with "When" or "For", as in this sentence itself. A comma still
                        follows the condition introduced by "When" or "For". The structure of a
                        sentence beginning with "Since" is like those beginning with "When" or "For"; a
                        comma follows the first clause. After "Since" or "Because", the concluding
                        clause <i>cannot</i> begin with "then" or "so"; "then" is used only with "If".

                    In English, the words "as" and "for" may be used to introduce a reason given
                    after the statement of the conclusion from that reason. For example:
                    "I ate early today, for I was hungry," or "He stopped writing his answer, as
                    time had expired." Banish these uses from mathematical writing; they introduce
                    confusion, especially for non-native readers. "As" also means "like", and
                    "for" is most often used to specify a universe. Compare "The degree is at
                    least one, for a vertex in the neighborhood" with "The degree is at least one,
                    for a vertex in the neighborhood is not isolated." The meanings of "for"
                    differ, but the reader does not discover that until the end of the sentence.

                    A long proof does not fit in a single sentence; hence often one needs a word
                    to start a sentence that states a conclusion. Among the choices are
                    "Therefore", "Hence", and "Thus". Purists (and copy editors) desire a comma
                    after every such introductory word or phrase (as they do after "Finally", "On
                    the other hand", "In 1965", etc.). This can make language overly formal.
    
                    <p>
                        Among these choices, I treat "Therefore" as the most formal, introducing a
                        major conclusion and hence taking a comma. Because "Hence" and "Thus" are
                        single syllables, I use them without commas to indicate the flow of argument
                        without making the writing choppy. This choice modifies strict English
                        punctuation in the service of mathematical understanding. It is not incorrect
                        to put commas after all these introductory words, but it enhances mathematical
                        communication to omit the commas after short words introducing short
                        conclusions that are just a step along the way. Copy editors put in the
                        commas, and I insist that they be removed again.

                    Since the reader will not know the author's intent, "by Theorem X" should
                    not be placed between a reason and a conclusion without clearer indication
                    of which meaning is intended. Dropping one comma makes it clearer, as in

                    can be written better as "By Theorem X, <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i>
                    edges, and therefore <i>G</i> is not planar". Alternatively, a reader
                    suggested using parentheses, as in "Note that <i>G</i> has at least <i>3n-5</i>

                    Because of its other uses in English, "So" is too informal to introduce a
                    sentence of conclusion (with or without being followed by a comma). It is best
                    to reserve "so" for use as a conjunction, like "but": "The graph is connected,
                    so each vertex is reachable from every other vertex." In this usage, no word
                    is needed to introduce the reason that precedes the conclusion.
                    As a <a class="link" href="#conjunctions">conjunction</a>, "so" is preceded by a comma, not a
                    semicolon: "The graph has no odd cycles, so it is bipartite." This form is
                    best used when the conclusion is short. <i>When "so" is used as a conjunction,
                        there is no "that"</i>. Thus "We have <i>x&sup2;=0</i>, so that <i>x=0</i>"

                    way. That is, "so that" requires a verb and describes how the action is done,
                    while "such that" restricts a noun. Compare "Consider a graph such that no

                    the same color. What follows "such that" modifies "graph", but what follows

                    A statement that is <i>assumed</i> is an axiom, considered throughout to be

                    that" is more appropriate to introduce a case or an argument by contradiction.
                    In contrast, "we may assume" introduces a consequence of an argument or
                    symmetry and henceforth will be true. I do not really understand the
                    phrase <i>"Assume for a contradiction that"</i>; use "Suppose to the contrary

                        verb. Omit "that" when what follows is just a noun unit, such as a notional
                        expression. For example, "Assume the hypothesis" is a complete sentence with
                        imperative verb and object. The structure is the same in "Suppose
                        <i>x+y&le;10</i>". When an English verb follows, we have "Suppose that
                        <i>f</i> is a proper coloring".
    
                        <p>
                            This distinction is a matter of some debate. Some more formal authors use
                            "Suppose that" when what follows is a formula containing a relational symbol,
                            treating the symbol as a verb. I think it is better to maintain the
                            consistency of treating formulas as noun units. The clarification accomplished
                            by "that" when a verb follows become unnecessary when the clause is condensed
                            into notation. When the notation is displayed, its role as a fact (noun) is
                            clearer and makes "that" especially unnecessary; the use of "that" should be
                            the same when the formula is not displayed. A related example is "the case
                            <i>k=2</i>", as opposed to "the case that <i>k=2</i>"; here "<i>k=2</i>" is the
                            case, which is a noun, so there is no "that".
    
                        <p>
                            Writers who always drop "that" from "Suppose that" have a valid point.
                            In spoken English, we usually drop "that" in this conntext to avoid ponderous
                            language. When the instruction is informal, without abstract concepts, it is
                            reasonable to drop "that". For example, "Suppose the hypothesis is true" would
                            be awkward with "that". Similarly, the very short "Suppose there is" would be
                            awkward with "that" after "Suppose". Here the verb is gone before one even
                            notices it; this is almost like "Suppose [notation]".
    
                        <p>
                            This exception may seem awkward. A better solution when introducing notation
                            is to avoid "Suppose <i>x</i> is" entirely: "Let <i>G</i> be a graph" is better
                            than "Suppose <i>G</i> is a graph". Compare "Suppose <i>x=1</i>" and "Let
                            <i>x=1</i>". The first assumes the truth of an equality and treats the
                            equation is a unit. The second is more active. Because we never say "Let that
                            . . .", we either view "Let" as the verb or view the equality sign as the verb.
                            This usage of "Let" is an exception to the treatment of
                            <a class="link" href="#expressions">expressions as noun units</a>; it is not used with
                            inequalities, because an inequality sign would need to be read as the lengthy
                            "be less than or equal to" to become a verb.

                    The word "any" can mean "some" or "all" in different contexts, so it can
                    be imprecise. It is clearer to use "each" or "every" as a universal
                    quantifier when referring to a singular object.
    
    
                    <p>
                        Numbered plural variables cause difficulty. In English, "for every two
                        elements" is awkward because "every" is singular. Thus here it is better to
                        say "for any two elements". The presence of "for" is suggestive of the
                        universal quantification and helps avoid ambiguity. Confusion can still arise:
                        consider "Form <i>G'</i> from <i>G</i> by adding an edge joining any two
                        vertices with distance 2 in <i>G</i>." Here some readers will think that only
                        one edge is added.
    
                        <p>
                            Avoiding "any" is not imperative. Evaluate its use in context, making sure
                            to prevent misinterpretation. "Any" is a good substitute for "an arbitrary",
                            and the meaning of "not any" is fairly clear.
                            ("arbitrary" indicates that all ways of making the choice are allowed.)

                            Using an indefinite article ("a" or "an") as a universal quantifier can be
                            dangerous, as in "Prove that a bipartite graph has no odd cycle." Some readers
                            (often students) may interpret "a" as "one" or "some", turning universality
                            into existence. Using "every" is clearer. Putting "must" before the
                            conclusion can suggest universality but is usually unnecessary.

                    holds is placed before the formula. In written words, a single universal
                    quantification may read better with the quantifier at the end. This order also
                    better emphasizes the conclusion. For example, one might prefer to change "For

                    <i>&chi;(G)&le;2</i> when <i>G</i> is bipartite". Similarly,

                    notation by referring to indexed elements or sets together as "the
                    <i>a<sub>i</sub>'s</i>". Usually "each <i>a<sub>i</sub></i>" or
                    "<i>a<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;a<sub>n</sub></i>" or some other notation is
                    preferable. Possessives and plurals of this sort should be reserved for
                    informal oral communication.

                    "Best possible" is an adjective used as a single term; it indicates sharpness.
                    We write "This result is best possible", just as we would write "This result is
                    sharp". "This result is the best possible" indicates that this result is
                    better or more valuable aesthetically than all other results in the world,
                    which is not what is meant. The definite article should not be used here.
                    Think of "best possible" as a technical term that is already a specific
                    predicate adjective, so no definite article is needed.
    
                    <p>
                        The informal phrase "is most likely" is similar to "is best possible"; there
                        is no article because "most likely" is used as a single term. It means that
                        the probability is high, whereas "is the most likely" means having higher
                        probability than any other outcome. Another example is "best practice", which
                        is a single technical term in areas of management. It is used as a single
                        term, without "the". For example, I have seen the title "Best Practices in
                        Online and Blended Learning and Teaching".
    
                        <p>Although "This result is best possible" is a complete sentence, it is
                            somewhat vague, since it does not specify the sense in which the result cannot
                            be improved. Often it is more informative to say something like "the constant
                            in the upper bound cannot be improved". For this reason, some writers suggest
                            avoiding the term "best possible".

                    <i>Numerals and spelled numbers.</i>
                    In standard English writing, numbers less than 10 usually are spelled in full,
                    while numbers more than 10 are written in numerals. In mathematical writing,
                    the basis for the distinction is different. Numbers less than 10 are spelled
                    out only when used as adjectives expressing the quantity of objects in a set.
                    They must remain as numerals when designating the value that a quantity equals.
                    For example, "The two vertices both have degree 3" or "A cycle of length 4 has
                    four edges" or "Consider a 4-vertex path" or "Consider a path with four
                    vertices". A reader provided another excellent example; compare the two

                    <br>
                    The first sentence says that the Betti invariant of <i>X</i> equals 1.
                    The second sentence says that the Betti invariant of <i>X</i> is a cycle.

                    like "Let <i>[n]:={1,&hellip;,n}</i>", then the verb states that the notation is

                    requires even more convoluted phrases when placed in a Double-Duty Definition.
                    This awkward notation is never needed and encourages grammatical errors.

                    For many reasons, the colon ":" is a far better choice than the vertical bar "|"
                    to mean "such that" in a "notation/condition" definition for a set. For
                    example, we may write "{<i>3n+1: n&isin;</i><b>N</b>}". The vertical bar
                    is heavily used in mathematics, most notably for size of sets, but also for
                    divisibility and other purposes. Using it for this purpose leads to such
                    messes as "{<i>|A|||A|||B|</i>}", which purports to describe the set of
                    sizes of sets <i>A</i> whose size divides the size of <i>B</i>. The colon is
                    far less used in mathematics. Even so, the best reason for using the colon is
                    that this mathematical usage is similar to the meaning of the character in
                    English; it separates part of a sentence from some elaboration of that part.
                    Finally, since "such that" is not a binary operator, this usage should be
                    expressed in TeX using "\colon\," instead of ":". As in English,
                    there should be space after the colon but not before it (or at least less space
                    before it).

                    In mathematics, a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of natural
                    numbers (perhaps with a shift of the initial element). Discrete mathematicians
                    abuse this term in using it for an ordered finite set. A good name for such an
                    object is <i>list</i>. An <i>n</i>-tuple is a list of length <i>n</i>. It is
                    an abuse of terminology to say "a sequence of length <i>n</i>".
                    (For finite graphs, in particular, "degree sequence" should be changed to
                    "degree list". To avoid this problem, one can sometimes refer to the "vertex
                    degrees" rather than the "degree sequence" or "degree list".)

                        The usage of "series" in English is contrary to its usage in mathematics.
                        In English a "series" usually consists of finitely many occurrences in order,
                        as in the "World Series" or the title "A Series of Unfortunate Events".
                        In mathematics a series is an infinite sum. So I believe, but one
                        correspondent tells me that a finite sum is also a series, though I would just
                        call it a summation or finite sum.

                We never use <i>f</i> to denote the value of a function <i>f</i> at a point
                <i>x</i>. The same principle applies to graph parameters and other operators.
                For example, the maximum degree of a graph <i>G</i> is denoted
                <i>&Delta;(G)</i>. Here <i>&Delta;</i> is a function, not a number, and hence
                <i>&Delta;</i> should not be used to denote the value of the function
                <i>&Delta;</i> on a particular graph.
    
                <p>
                    It is tempting for mnemonic reasons to write "We write <i>V=V(G)</i> and
                    <i>&Delta;=&Delta;(G)</i>". Admittedly, this usage is not confusing when
                    discussing only one graph at a time; the difference between a graph invariant
                    and a real-valued function is that we rarely focus on the value of a real-valued
                    function at just one point. Nevertheless, it is rare that a paper discusses
                    only one graph, and hence it is better to use <i>V(G)</i> and <i>&Delta;(G)</i>
                    for objects associated with <i>G</i>. The problem is particularly bad with
                    <i>&Delta;</i>, since this character also occurs in mathematics as a difference
                    operator. One often sees "<i>&Delta;n</i>" meaning the change in the value of
                    <i>n</i>, so one should not use "<i>&Delta;n</i>" to mean the maximum degree
                    times the number of vertices in a graph. (In my textbook I violated this
                    principle by using <i>n(G)</i> and <i>e(G)</i> for the numbers of vertices and
                    edges in a graph <i>G</i> while using <i>n</i> for the number of vertices of
                    a particular graph and <i>e</i> as a particular edge; the error will be
                    corrected in the third edition.)

                    The expression "<i>k</i> connected graphs" refers to <i>k</i> graphs that are
                    connected, in contrast to "<i>k</i>-connected graphs", which are graphs having
                    the property of being <i>k</i>-connected. Note also that an expression
                    involving addition or subtraction used as a parameter modifying a noun
                    should be enclosed in parentheses before the hyphen. For example, write
                    "<i>(k+1)</i>-connected graph", not "<i>k+1</i>-connected graph".
    
                    This hyphenation rule applies whenever notation is used to modify or
                    further specify the subsequent word. Examples include "<i>k</i>-cycle",
                    "<i>n</i>-vertex graph", "<i>p</i>-group", etc.
    
                    A related hyphenation issue is particularly important in graph theory.
                    A "<i>k</i>-edge connected graph" is a connected graph with <i>k</i> edges
                    (compare with "<i>n</i>-vertex connected graph"); the meaning is different
                    from "<i>k</i>-edge-connected graph". When the hyphen is missing,
                    "<i>k</i>-edge" modifies "connected graph" because adjectives modify only
                    nouns, not other adjectives. Similarly, a non-specialist reader would think
                    that a <i>k</i>-edge coloring is a coloring of <i>k</i>-edges, not a coloring
                    of edges using <i>k</i> colors. This example can be viewed as following
                    the general rule: "<i>k</i>" is modifying "edge-coloring"

                    In graph theory, many fundamental concepts involving vertices have analogues

                    "connectivity" or "chromatic number", but we add "edge" for the analogous edge
                    concept. We then hyphenate "edge-connectivity" and "edge-chromatic number".
                    In both cases, the problem for edges is a special case (for line graphs) of the
                    general problem.

                        Furthermore, using the hyphen in the edge context maintains

                        lists, so the hyphenation of the term is different.

                            The presence of the word "vertex" sometimes becomes an issue. As mentioned
                            above, the fundamental parameters involve vertices and do not require the word
                            "vertex" as a modifier. Similarly, when we speak of "disjoint subgraphs", it
                            must be that they cannot share anything, vertices or edges, so the word
                            "vertex" is unnecessary. The concept "edge-disjoint" indicates a less
                            restrictive condition. Saying "vertex disjoint" suggests vertices as an
                            alternative to edges; it is better just to say "disjoint". Clearly disjoint
                            cycles share no vertices.

                    Two-word terms used as single concepts to modify nouns must be hyphenated when
                    placed before the noun, such as in this sentence (without the hyphen, we would
                    be discussing two "word terms"). This is particularly necessary when the first

                    instance of this error is "polynomial time algorithm"; "polynomial-time" must
                    be hyphenated when used as an adjective. In constrast, the hyphen is dropped
                    when the expression is not being used to modify something else, as in

                    <p>
                        The adverb "well" is a possible exception. In "well-known theorem" we think of
                        the combination "well-known" as a single technical term, leading to "A
                        well-known theorem is a theorem that is well known." The term "well-defined"
                        also behaves this way. However, opinion on this point is sharply divided; some
                        authors insist that because "well" is an adverb the term should not be
                        hyphenated. Further support for the hyphen: the mathematical usage of "well"
                        in the hyphenated term differs from the English usage of "well" is the
                        unhyphenated expression. A "well defined function" is a function for which we
                        have done a good job of giving a definition, but a "well-defined function" is
                        an object that has been given a valid definition as a function, with
                        every domain element given a unique image.

                    by itself. Even worse, often <i>x-y</i> is treated as a mathematical expression

                    <i>Order and size of a graph.</i>
                    Traditionally, the terms "order" and "size" refer to the number of vertices
                    and number of edges of a graph. These terms are not as popular as they once
                    were; "order" has too many other mathematical uses, and "size" without a
                    clear context is confusing, sometimes taken to mean the number of vertices.
                    Some writers thus prefer "number of vertices" and "number of edges".
    
                    <p>
                        It must be admitted that "order" and "size" are quite convenient, while overuse
                        of "number of vertices" and "number of edges" becomes quite awkward.
                        Introducing notation for the numbers of vertices and edges minimizes this
                        difficulty. Unfortunately, there is no generally agreed notation for operators
                        returning the numbers of vertices and edges of a graph <i>G</i>. The only
                        notation that cannot be misunderstood is the absence of special notation:
                        <i>|V(G)|</i> and <i>|E(G)|</i>, using notation for cardinality of finite
                        sets that is standard throughout mathematics. Nevertheless, these expressions
                        seems cumbersome to use repeatedly, so it is often beneficial to write "Let
                        <i>n=|V(G)|</i> and <i>m=|E(G)|</i>."

                    <i>Graphs are not sets.</i>
                    When <i>h</i> is a vertex in a graph <i>G</i>, it makes no sense to write
                    <i>h&isin; G</i>, since <i>h</i> could just as easily be an edge. A graph
                    consists of a vertex set and an edge set; one should write <i>v&isin; V(G)</i>
                    and <i>e&isin; E(G)</i>. This is also a reason why the convenient notations
                    <i>|G|</i> and <i>||G||</i> for the order and size of a graph are problematic.
                    When one sees <i>|G|</i>, how does one know whether it is the number of
                    vertices or the number of edges?
    
                    <p>On the other hand, it is true that we write <i>G-v</i> and <i>G-e</i> for
                        deletion of a vertex <i>v</i> or edge <i>e</i> from a graph <i>G</i>, defining
                        "<i>-</i>" in the context of the objects it operates on. In this sense, it
                        would also be legitimate to define the meaning of the cardinality and norm
                        operators when operating on a graph. However, until there is very strong and
                        widespread support for this usage, it seems wisest to stick to the notation
                        <i>|V(G)|</i> and <i>|E(G)|</i> that is understood by all mathematicians.

                            subset <i>A</i>. It can then be useful to define <i>||A||</i> to be
                            <i>|E(G[A])|</i>, the number of edges in the subgraph of <i>G</i> induced by
                            <i>A</i>.

                    These models are variations or generalizations of graphs.
                    In a digraph, the edge set consists of ordered pairs. The redundancy of
                    saying "directed edge" or "directed path" or "directed cycle" is not helpful,
                    as it suggests that the digraph contains such objects that are not directed
                    (the term "weak path" is available for a path in the underlying undirected
                    graph). Unnecessarily adding the adjective "directed" in a context where
                    the default should incorporate that notion also prevents making statements
                    that hold in the context of both graphs and digraphs, like Menger's Theorem.
    
                    <p>
                        Similarly, one should not use "hyperedges" to refer to the edges of a
                        hypergraph. Hypergraphs generalize graphs by allowing edges to have arbitrary
                        size. Calling them "hyperedges" eliminates the possibility of saying that
                        graphs arise as a special case, since graphs have edges, not hyperedges.

                    Many mathematicians use these words interchangeably. One can make a useful
                    distinction by using "maximum" to compare numbers or sizes and "maximal" to
                    compare sets or other objects. Thus a <i>maximal</i> object of type <i>A</i>
                    is an object of type <i>A</i> that is not contained in any other object of type
                    <i>A</i>. A <i>maximum</i> object of type <i>A</i> is a largest object of type
                    <i>A</i>; here "maximum" is an abbreviation for "maximum-sized". For example,
                    in a graph we may speak of "maximal independent sets" and "maximum independent
                    sets"; these are convenient terms for distinct concepts that are both important.
    
                    <p>
                        Although this distinction is sensible and has become established in many
                        settings (such as "maximum antichain" and "maximum independent set"), potential
                        confusion can be reduced by using "largest" and "smallest" instead of "maximum"
                        and "minimum". For example, it is harder to misinterpret "a largest matching"
                        than to misinterpret "a maximum matching".
    
                        <p>

                            numerical values. This is consistent with usage in continuous mathematics,
                            where we write that a continuous function "attains its maximum" on a closed
                            and bounded set.

                    the meanings of "clique of size 5" and "5-clique" (the same) are clear. In

                    in specifying paths, cycles, and complete graphs they must refer to the
                    isomorphism classes.
    
                    <p>
                        Hence we should never write "a <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>" for a member of that class.
                        We can write that a graph "contains a path with <i>n</i> vertices",
                        because that is a structural description of the subgraph, but we cannot write
                        "contains a <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>" or "consider a <i>P<sub>n</sub></i> in

                        number drop the word "proper" and use <i>k-[edge-]coloring</i> for the
                        restricted concept. The minor convenience gained by dropping this word is
                        overwhelmed by the negative influence of introducing inconsistency of
                        terminology in combinatorics. Use "proper <i>k</i>-coloring" when that is what
                        is meant. For other variations, such as "acyclic <i>k</i>-coloring" or
                        "dynamic <i>k</i>-coloring", the adjectives replace "proper" by imposing
                        further restrictions on the <i>k</i>-coloring, so the word "proper" is then no
                        longer needed.

                    <i>Partitions vs. parts</i>
                    A partition consists of blocks or "parts". Do not use "partition" to refer
                    to the members of a partition. (Students often make this mistake.)
    
                    <p>A <i>bipartition</i> is a partition into two parts. In particular,
                        we say that a bipartition of a bipartite graph is a partition of its vertex
                        set into two independent sets. In the past I used "partite sets" to refer
                        to the parts of such a partition, but there are objections to that term,
                        and students never get it (for example, they refer to one "partite" of a graph,
                        and certainly "partite" is not a noun. Hence I now refer to the "parts" of
                        a bipartite graph. This is a slight abuse of terminology, but I think its
                        familiarity as a word better facilitates discussion.

                    <i>"Pairwise" and "mutually".</i>
                    Old-fashioned mathematics took the old-fashioned word "mutually" to describe
                    a binary relation satisfied by all pairs in a set, as in "a set of mutually
                    orthogonal Latin squares". In English usage, "mutual" indicates symmetry in
                    a more global way. Hence modern mathematics should avoid using "mutually"
                    to mean "pairwise"; the word "pairwise" states exactly what is meant. The
                    change becomes even more important in light of modern terms like "mutual
                    independence" in which "mutual" explicitly does not mean "pairwise". (Thus
                    "mutually orthogonal Latin squares" is now ambiguous, but we cannot escape the
                    notation "MOLS(n,k)" in design theory.)

                    <i>Pairwise disjoint/isomorphic.</i>
                    The phrase "Consider disjoint sets <i>A<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;A<sub>k</sub></i>"
                    is technically incorrect; we should instead say "pairwise disjoint sets".
                    However, this is a universally understood abuse of terminology, and including
                    the word "pairwise" each time would be ponderous. Hence we understand a
                    family of disjoint sets to be pairwise disjoint. The point is that many
                    binary relations really make sense essentially only in a binary context.
                    This principle extends to other commonly used binary relations do not make
                    non-binary sense, such as "isomorphic".

                    <i>Disjoint union vs. join.</i>
                    In much of graph theory, the notation <i>rG</i> indicates a graph consisting of
                    <i>r</i> disjoint copies of <i>G</i>. For consistency, <i>G+H</i> should
                    therefore denote the disjoint union of two graphs <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>.
                    For example, <i>P<sub>n<sub>1</sub></sub>+&hellip;+P<sub>n<sub>k</sub></sub></i>
                    denotes a linear forest, consisting of <i>k</i> components that are paths with
                    orders <i>n<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,n<sub>k</sub></i>.
    
                    <p>
                        Some authors use <i>G+H</i> instead (or also!) to denote the <i>join</i> of
                        <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>, which consists of the disjoint union plus edges
                        joining every vertex of <i>G</i> to every vertex of <i>H</i>. Other notation
                        has been used, such as <i>G</i>&or;<i>H</i>, borrowing the join operation
                        (<i>x&or;y</i>) in lattices or logic, but this is not satisfactory.
                        Instead the best notation for the graph join is \diamondplus (unavailable
                        in html?) which overstrikes a diamond and a plus, much like "&oplus;" except
                        with a rotated square whose corners are at the points of the "+"
                        ("&oplus;" is unavailable because it represents symmetric difference
                        or binary sum). The \diamondplus is consistent with the Nesetril notation
                        for graph products: the symbol is a picture of the result of applying the
                        operation to two copies of <i>K<sub>2</sub></i>. In addition, the use of
                        "+" indicates that the number of vertices is additive.

                    An object that is between two other objects separates them; this is the common
                    mathematical sense of "between". Referring to an edge (or path) with endpoints
                    <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> as an edge "between" <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> is somewhat
                    inconsistent with the rest of mathematics. One can say "an edge <i>joining</i>
                    <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>" instead. In a planar embedding of a graph, an edge
                    shared by the boundaries of two faces is an an edge between the faces.

                    for deletion of elements, as in "<i>G\setminus e</i>". Use "<i>G-e</i>"
                    instead. Also, the notation <i>G\setminus H</i> is easily confused with
                    <i>G/H</i> (especially by students). Of course, there are some contexts
                    (matroids and various algebraic topics), where these notations have special
                    meanings and are quite important, but for simple set difference <i>A-B</i> is

                    It is traditional correct style in English grammar that all terminal

                    was to lessen the danger of breakage of fixed metal type in printing presses.
                    In the era of electronic publishing of mathematics, this justification is
                    obsolete, and we can replace the convention with logical punctuation. When the
                    material being quoted is treated as an item within the sentence and is not
                    itself a sentence, the terminal punctuation logically comes outside the
                    quotation marks. Copy editors trained in literary punctuation still object to
                    logical punctuation but should be overruled.

                    concern calculus, and she will attend them all. In common English, the
                    distinction is perhaps even clearer: compare

                    1) "I have two shirts that need cleaning."

                        When the phrase after the relative pronoun specifies a further restriction
                        of the class that has just been introduced, the correct pronoun is "that", and
                        the subsequent phrase tells which of the items in the class are those being
                        discussed. If the subsequent phrase speaks about the totality of the class,
                        then the proper pronoun is "which". When "that" and "which"
                        both seem usable, use "that" when the sense is "having the property that",
                        and use "which" when the sense is "all of which" or "the only one of
                        which". Usually a comma is appropriate before "which". Usually "that" is
                        correct when an indefinite article ("a" or "an") has been used on the word
                        being modified. <i>Beware:</i> This distinction is not made or is made the
                        opposite way in British English. Some American style manuals don't care,
                        but in mathematics there are two distinct meanings to be expressed.

                    When using "which", "that", "where", or other words to introduce
                    explanatory or descriptive phrases, the subsequent phrase modifies the most
                    recent item. For example, "an embedding of <i>G</i> on a surface which has no
                    crossings" indicates that the surface has no crossings, not that the embedding
                    has no crossings. Making the comment on crossings apply to the embedding
                    requires rewriting: "On a specified surface, consider an embedding of <i>G</i>,
                    which has no crossings". Here "which" is proper because every embedding has
                    no crossings; an embedding is a drawing <i>that</i> has no crossings.

                    When "This" is used as the subject of a sentence, its antecedent is the
                    most recent noun. If the desired antecedent is the preceding paragraph or
                    some other object, then a noun should be inserted, as in "This discussion
                    implies" or "This inequality implies" instead of merely "This implies".
                    One way to understand this issue is to view "this" only as an adjective, not
                    as a pronoun.

                    The word "every" is <i>singular</i>; it means "each one". Because of this, we
                    write "all values" or "every value"; not "all value" or "every values".
    
                    <p>
                        The word "distinct" has the same meaning as "different". Two things
                        can be distinct, but one thing cannot be distinct. Thus the sentence "Every
                        value is distinct" is incorrect; it has no meaning. Many beginning students
                        think it means that each value is different from every other value, but it does
                        not.
    
                        <p> The word "unique" indicates that there is only one of the items being
                            described. It does not mean that this item is different from other items.
                            Some students think that "The function <i>f</i> maps the points in <i>A</i> to
                            unique points in <i>B</i>" is a statement that <i>f</i> is injective, but it is
                            not. Every function from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> maps each point in <i>A</i> to a
                            unique point in <i>B</i>.

                            The distinction between the words "distinct" and "unique" is made clear by a
                            typical boast on the World Wide Web. The sentence "Our website has one million
                            unique visitors" makes no sense. The intent is to say that among millions of
                            hits there are one million <i>distinct</i> visitors; if there is a unique
                            visitor, then there is no other visitor.

                    example, "graph colorability" is an indefinite concept, so we do not say "Next
                    we discuss the graph colorability". In contrast, "chromatic number" may be
                    abstract or specific. We may say "Next we discuss chromatic number", referring
                    to the general concept, or "Next we discuss the chromatic number of this
                    graph", since this graph has only one value as its chromatic number.
    
                    <p>
                        Functions or parameters assign a number to each domain object. The resulting
                        value is specific for the object; there is only one choice for it. Hence we
                        do not say "the graph has a chromatic number 3" or "the vertex has a degree 3".
                        These sentences suggest that the object may have more than one value of the
                        parameter. The answer to the question "What is the degree of this vertex?"
                        may be "This vertex has degree 3", but it cannot be "This vertex has a degree
                        3".
    
                        <p>
                            We also do not say "This vertex has the degree 3", although "The degree of this
                            vertex is 3" is correct. Consider the sentence "Every graph has an even number
                            of vertices with odd degree, which means that the list of vertex degrees has
                            even sum." The term "even number" takes the article "an" because we are saying
                            which type of number is being used (it is one of the even numbers). The later
                            "odd degree" and "even sum" do not, because these are properties that the
                            vertices and the list do or do not satisfy. Articles are inappropriate when
                            invoking a property.
    
                        <p>
                            Articles also are not used with conceptual nouns. Compare with familiar
                            conversation: we say "This chair has value $100" and not "This chair has the
                            value
                            $100." "Value" and "degree" are abstract properties. Here is another
                            non-mathematical example: We say "I receive compensation for my work,"
                            not "I receive a compensation for my work." Compensation is an amount, but here
                            only the abstract concept of receiving compensation is meant, not some number
                            of things. Hence we do not use an article.
    
                        <p>
                            Similarly, abstract properties do not take articles. We say "because
                            transitivity of A implies transitivity of B", not "because the transitivity of
                            A implies the transitivity of B". The property in question is "transitivity",
                            not "the transitivity".

                <a name="possesstit">
                    <i>Possessives and titles.</i>
                    The definite article "the" specifies uniqueness. Possessives also play this
                    role. It is incorrect to use both together, because the possessive already
                    provides definite specification. For example, we write "Greene's Theorem"
                    but not "the Greene's Theorem"; this is a theorem proved by Greene, not by
                    "the Greene".
    
                    <p>
                        When discussing a result by two authors, we cannot put possessives on both
                        names, because there is only one object (compare with "Greene's and Kleitman's
                        theorems"). Making only the second name possessive would be correct in English
                        grammar but poor mathematical style ("Greene and Kleitman's Theorem", like
                        "Dick and Jane's house). The main reason this is poor mathematical style
                        is that the entire phrase is a title. Hence we write "the Greene--Kleitman
                        Theorem", like "the Woolbright-Abernathy House". Here "the" serves as a
                        definite article for the unique object with the title "Greene--Kleitman
                        Theorem". When the result is less celebrated and not known by its authors'
                        names, one can indicate the possessive by "of", as in "the theorem of Greene
                        and Kleitman".

                    <i>Capitalization of titles.</i>
                    In the examples above, "Theorem" is capitalized. When there is only one
                    instance of an object, and the name of it involves a person, it plays the role
                    of a proper noun and its name is a title. Another example is "the
                    Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality". Although some style sheets vote against
                    capitalization based on "common usage", failing to capitalize does not
                    reflect the true meaning and seems to be mostly a matter of laziness.
                    We would have the Chinese remainder theorem (as opposed to the French one),
                    the Hungarian method (as opposed to the Austrian one), and the
                    mean value theorem (as opposed to the nice value theorem).

                    Some graph theorists use "Hamilton cycle" to mean a spanning cycle in a graph,
                    but they would never say "Abel group". When describing a type of cycle, the
                    modifier should be an adjective, so it is better to use an adjectival form of
                    the name when that is available: "Hamiltonian cycle". The same applies to
                    "Euler circuit" and "Eulerian circuit". <i>However</i>, some uses of names as
                    adjectives are heavily ingrained and unchangeable, such as "Fibonacci numbers"
                    and "Catalan numbers". In these examples adjectival forms are not readily
                    available (we do have "Eulerian numbers").

                    <i>Conjunctions and commas.</i>
                    Punctuation shapes sentences; commas encourage the reader to pause at places
                    where doing so aides understanding. Missing commas may require the reader to
                    stop and re-read in order to understand what has been said. Excessive commas
                    delay the reader and impede the flow of logic.
    
                    <p>
                        Two clauses (in essence, two complete sentences) may be combined using a
                        <i>conjunction</i>; the conjuction must be preceded by a comma. Examples of
                        conjunctions are "and", "but", "then", and "so" (the latter should be treated
                        as conjunctions in mathematical writing). Since a conjunction joins two
                        things, sentences should not begin with these words. This is a logical
                        approach that helps keep writing clear, though strict English usage (especially
                        British) may call some of these words adverbs. See further comments on the use
                        of <a class="link" href="#letthen">then</a> and <a class="link" href="#sothat">so</a>.

                            The situation is more complicated when the second clause itself contains a
                            conjunction. Compare "If A, then B holds and C holds" with "If A, then B
                            holds, and C holds". In the first sentence, it is clear that A implies both B
                            and C. The proper grouping or meaning in the second sentence is unclear.
                            Since we only have one comma symbol and don't parenthesize sentences to
                            indicate grouping, a short conjunction of two sentences within a larger
                            conjunction is written without a comma.

                    Compound sentences consist of two complete sentences with no conjunction
                    separating them. This form is used especially when the second part clarifies
                    or comments on the first. Such sentences need a semicolon (not a comma!) to
                    separate the two parts; this sentence is an example. Do not use a semicolon
                    before a conjunction; in particular, there should never be a semicolon before
                    "and", "but", "then", or "so".

                    <i>Excessive commas.</i>
                    A clause requires a subject and a verb. When "and" joins two parts of a
                    sentence that do not both stand on their own with a subject and a verb, there
                    should be no comma before it. The comma in "We will prove the lemma, and then
                    the theorem" is incorrect; one must delete the comma or add a subject and
                    verb to the second part. This example came from a newspaper: "In February,
                    the graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, was awarded the
                    A--B--C Prize"; here there should be no comma before "was". (See further

                    <i>Serial commas.</i> A serial comma is a comma after the next-to-last element
                    of a list. Wikipedia gives a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">discussion</a> of its
                    use. It
                    is generally safest to use a comma in this situation. For example, compare
                    "Under the conditions <i>1&le; i,k&le; r</i> and <i>m</i> even" with
                    "Under the conditions <i>1&le; i</i>, <i>k&le; r</i>, and <i>m</i> even";
                    the two sentences have different meanings. The issue arises often when
                    listing three mathematical objects or three authors. (For a list of lists,
                    clarity can be achieved by using semicolons or by changing "and" to "&" within
                    list items.)
    
                    <p>
                        One reason for using the serial comma in lists is to avoid confusion in
                        sentences that do not contain lists. Consider the sentences
                        "Like <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> have the same property" and
                        "Later, Early and Jones proved the conjecture". These are not lists, and using
                        a comma would be wrong, but when a document does not use serial commas these
                        examples initially appear to be lists. Similarly, in that context an item in a
                        list that itself joins two subitems with "and" looks like the last two items in
                        a list.
    
                        <p>
                            Omitting the serial comma can also cause confusion mathematically, as in
                            "The value of <i>f</i> is positive at 2, negative at 1 and 0 at 0."

                    <i>Appositives.</i></a> An appositive is a noun or noun phrase that renames or
                substitutes for another noun or noun phrase immediately preceding or following
                it. It can be recognized by the fact that omitting it would yield a clear and
                complete sentence and that the additional information in it is not
                grammatically essential to the statement being made. It should be set off by
                commas: "His book, the best book on the subject, took years to write. An
                appositive in the middle of a sentence cannot have a comma on only one side.
    
                <p>
                    When an appositive is short enough or contains essential information, the
                    commas are omitted: "My friend Bob is a student." In mathematical writing, a
                    similar situation applies when notation is introduced: "The <i>degree</i>
                    <i>d(v)</i> of a vertex <i>v</i> is the number of neighbors of <i>v</i>." Here
                    "<i>d(v)</i>" is a brief appositive. One could argue that the notation for
                    "degree" is not essential to the sense of the sentence, but putting commas
                    around very short appositives can produce very choppy sentences. A speaker
                    need not pause for such appositives, and hence one may omit the commas.

                    Good writers of English minimize the use of passive voice. This accepted

                    exposition more engaging; for example, "It suffices to show" is preferable
                    to "It is sufficient to show". Nevertheless, judicious use of the passive
                    voice can be appropriate.

                    When a word in English initially has a negation introduced by prefixing "non",
                    the resulting word is hyphenated. The initial sense is the negation, so the
                    hyphen is appropriate. As decades pass and the word is accepted on its own,
                    it becomes a positive concept incorporating the "non". This and familiarity
                    lead to dropping the hyphen. Some of the most familiar examples in mathematics
                    are "nonsingular", "nontrivial", "nonzero", and "nonconstructive". Adding
                    hyphens to these words is now jarring to more readers than is the absence of

                    However, I would keep the hyphen in "non-word" and "non-edge", for clarity

                    Many non-native speakers use "bound of" when they mean "bound on".
                    If <i>x&le; k</i>, then we have an upper bound of <i>k</i> on <i>x</i>. Using
                    "bound of <i>x</i>" for "bound on <i>x</i>" can become confusing when comparing
                    parameters. We do not want to say that the maximum degree <i>&Delta;(G)</i> is
                    a bound of the chromatic number <i>&chi;(G)</i>; when <i>&Delta;(G)=k</i> we
                    want to say that <i>&Delta;(G)</i> establishes a bound <i>of</i> <i>k</i>
                    <i>on</i> the chromatic number of the graph. (Writers from Asia typically
                    overuse the preposition "of" when many others are more accurate, such as
                    "on", "for", "about", etc.)

                <a name="few">
                    <i>"few" vs "a few".</i>
                    In English, "few" means "not many", while "a few" means "several".
                    The sentence "In this paper we prove few good results" means that the
                    paper does nothing worthwhile, while "In this paper we prove a few good
                    results" means that it is worth reading.
    
                    <p>
            <li>
                <a name="usual">
                    <i>"Usual".</i>
                    It is a quirk of English that the word "usual" as an adjective usually requires
                    the definite article "the". We cannot say "In this section we consider only
                    usual chromatic number"; it must be "In this section we consider only the usual
                    chromatic number". (This is a common error by speakers of languages that
                    do not have articles.)
    
                    <p>
            <li>
                <a name="partialcase">
                    <i>"Partial case".</i>
                    In English, we do not say that one result is a "partial case" of another.
                    We say that it is a "special case". (This is an issue of translation from one
                    language to another.) However, it is correct to say that proving a special
                    case of a conjecture is a partial result.
    
                    <p>
            <li>
                <a name="pass">
                    <i>"Pass" vs. "Pass through".</i>
                    In English, the word "pass" means "go by without entering". Thus a path that
                    passes a vertex does not visit that vertex. To say that path <i>P</i> visits
                    vertex <i>v</i>, one should say that <i>P</i> <i>passes through</i> <i>v</i>
                    (this is a language translation issue). Better yet, just use "visits".
    
                    <p>
            <li>
                <a name="cannot">
                    <i>"Can not" and "may be".</i>
                    It appears that some writers of English now use "can not" to mean "cannot".
                    In speech the two cannot be distinguished, so it doesn't matter, but in written
                    mathematics we should avoid ambiguities. The logical meaning of "can not fail"
                    is "may possibly succeed" while "cannot fail" means "must succeed". At the
                    very least, when "can not" is used to mean "cannot" it can be read to have a
                    different meaning, so it is better to use "cannot" to eliminate the ambiguity.
                    As in many of these items, the abstractness of mathematical statements in
                    contrast to the everyday context of English language begs a higher level of
                    precision and avoidance of ambiguity.
    
                    <p>
                        The expression "may be" does exist in English, when used as a verb as in "It
                        may be true" or "This may be the only component". However, when it appears at
                        the start of a clause most likely the word "maybe" is intended, as in "Maybe
                        this proof will work. In this situation there is another verb ("work"), and
                        the initial expression means "Possibly", which is not a verb.
    
                        <p>
            <li>
                <a name="jointwork">
                    <i>"A joint work".</i>
                    We speak of "a theorem" or "a result", since these are definite specific items
                    but "work" is an <a class="link" href="articles">abstract noun</a> and does not take the
                    indefinite article "a". We say simply "This is work of mine", not "This is a
                    work of mine", and "This is joint work with my colleague," not "This is a joint
                    work". This usage of "work" is different from "a work of art" or "the complete
                    works of Shakespeare". In mathematics, "work" is equivalent to "research"; we
                    do not say "this is a joint research". The same error occurs in
                    "I will have a limited access to my email."
    
                    <p>
            <li>
                <a name="evidently">
                    <i>"Evidently".</i>
                    Some nonnative speakers write "Evidently" to mean "Clearly". Although this
                    word is not technically incorrect, it has other connotations to native
                    speakers. Combining this with the fact that they would always write "Clearly"
                    and never "Evidently", they are confused about what the writer means.
                    Always change "Evidently" to "Clearly". ("Evidently" is quite close to
                    "apparently", which in American English means "seems to be true" rather than
                    "is true".)
    
                    <p>
                        Similarly, "as evidenced by" generally is not used in English; change to "as
                        shown by".

                <a name="principle">
                    <i>"Principal" vs. "principle".</i>
                    "Principal" is an adjective meaning "foremost", used mathematically in
                    "principal minor". "Principle" is a noun similar to "idea" or "method",
                    as in "the Pigeonhole Principle".</i>
